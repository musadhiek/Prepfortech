There are given N ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths. The task is to connect the ropes with minimum cost.
Example 1:
Input: n = 4 arr[] = {4, 3, 2, 6} Output: 29

min h;

//insert everything in the min heap

while(pq.size()>1)
{
int x =pq.top();
pq.pop();
int y=pq.top();
pq.pop();

int s=x+y;

pq.push(sum);

cost+=sum;
}
return cost;
}
